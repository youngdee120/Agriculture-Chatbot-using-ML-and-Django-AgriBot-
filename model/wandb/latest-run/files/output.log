Passing a tuple of `past_key_values` is deprecated and will be removed in Transformers v4.48.0. You should pass an instance of `EncoderDecoderCache` instead, e.g. `past_key_values=EncoderDecoderCache.from_legacy_cache(past_key_values)`.

 start> it seems like there are many important reasons soil drainage is vital for banana trees that help in planting the mango trees to produce well organized soiling helps manage soil growth and reduces the spread of diseases as you can make sure all natural minerals from their vines should be separated with each other 3 why so many different nutrients add vitamin D supplements such as calcium magnesium and potassium potassium provide optimal drainage at a wide range 1 how can farmers understand what amene levels when harvesting banana tree seedlings do not have a drainage system around the bottom layer structure between banana cultivation 2 how can your cultivation balance food irrigation

Beam  > <pad> <unk> seems like that particular topic wasn t in my last update could you reframe that for me <unk></s>
Sample> <pad> <unk> to reduce the use of soils in banana cultivation we should consider the importance of an organic environment for irrigation and drainage at the same time before planting plant trees you need regular nitrogen per 100 ml of oil into water and add new soils composting helps in managing disease spread by reducing the risk that is associated with farming practices using apical methods help in ensuring the soil can be used during drought cycles where some nutrients are needed must be provided have adequate nutrition 3 how often should i maintain soil fertility while maintaining good overall drinking conditions allow optimal growth after being planted as well as other fertilizers

Sample> start> hey for banana cultivation you can consider the importance of soil drainage when using water in the soil this reduces soil fertility and promote higher soil quality farmers are making use of compost fertilizers to enhance soil yield by planting fruit or vegetable crops here are some important points that contribute to enhancing soil balance irrigation systems such as irrigation systems and irrigation services 1 how does soil formation assist with banana cultivation 2 what is the key role at each plant 7 how often should grape trees be used during the drought please press any number to ask the question end>
Beam  > soil drainage plays a crucial role in banana cultivation here s how it helps soil drainage for banana cultivation depends on the information provided in the context soil drainage is a key component of soil drainage which can help in maintaining soil health and fertility improves soil quality ensures proper application of soil water to reduce the risk of pest diseases and disease spreads by reducing the need for fertilizer use of antibiotics used in banana farming 1 how often does soil drainage play a important role in potato cultivation 2 what are the benefits of using nutrient enriching bananas please press any number to ask the question
Sample> soil drainage plays a crucial role in banana cultivation here are some key points to consider when considering the importance of water and humidity for banana plants fertilizer can be applied over time by applying irrigation systems like weeds and irritants shrubbery composting can also be provided at different levels below the recommended size used organic crops should use good soil management practices like planting specific green areas and planting an additional layer of soil is suitable for sustainable farmers preferable soil conditions that may be better served on the farm with beneficial nutrients will need adequate water preparation or not depending upon the rainfall criteria allow 1 how does soil fertility
